Description: Python ctypes bindings to the Monocypher library
 # pymonocypher
 .
 This python package uses cython to wrap the Monocypher C library. 
 Monocypher is an easy to use, easy to deploy, auditable crypto library
 written in portable C.  
 .
 Normal Python installations have access to a wide
 selection of quality crypto libraries.  This python binding is intended to
 communicate with other implementations that do use the Monocypher library.
 A typical application is to communicate with a microcontroller that 
 uses Monocypher.

  *   Monocypher [official site](https://monocypher.org/)
 .
 The Python binding API mirrors the underlying C API, but with 
 simplifications to only pass bytes objects, not uint8_t * and length.
